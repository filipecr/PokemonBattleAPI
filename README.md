# PokemonBattleAPI

## Introduction

Hello World.
I wanted to make an API that would feed a website and simulate something like PokemonShowdown.

Pokémon Showdown is an online platform where players can engage in simulated battles using Pokémon, the fictional creatures from the Pokémon franchise. Unlike the main games where players catch and train Pokémon through an adventure, Pokémon Showdown focuses purely on the battling aspect.

This project is merely for a practice purpose, where I try to apply some concepts that I've learned.
